      # Konfipay::initialize_credit_transfer
      #
      # Format of data returned is:
      #
      # {"final"=>false,
      #  "success"=>true,
      #  "data"=>
      #   {"rId"=>"ef2abc7e-62b8-4603-8994-61a716e9fa81",
      #    "timestamp"=>"2022-06-08T16:20:52+02:00",
      #    "type"=>"pain",
      #    "paymentStatusItem"=>
      #     {"status"=>"FIN_UPLOAD_SUCCEEDED",
      #      "uploadTimestamp"=>"2022-06-08T16:20:53+02:00",

      # 
      # or it can raise a connection error exception.
      #
      # "final" means the process has finished, successfully or not.
      # "success" is when the money is on the way - note that it's not always possible to completely
      # know if the transactions are "done", this gem assumes that success is reached when the bank
      # has acknowledged the receipt of the payment info without error.
      # See Konfipay::Operations::Base#parse_pain_status for details, and also which "status" strings can
      # be returned by the Konfipay API.
      # "data" is verbatim what the Konfipay API returned for the initial process start.
      # Note that rId is needed to identify this transfer process on all subsequent (manual) API calls.
